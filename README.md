# Wave (Decompiled High School Project)

This repository contains a **decompiled and partially restored version** of *Wave*, a game I originally developed during high school.  
Because this version was reconstructed from the original executable, the project is **not buildable from source**. The code is provided here for **portfolio and archival purposes only**, to demonstrate my ability to recover, refactor, and document legacy projects.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- This is **not the original source code** — it was decompiled and cleaned up for readability.  
- The project cannot be compiled into a working build.  
- To experience the game, you’ll need to run the original executable.
